#  Hello, I'm Orlando

Software development is a continuous learning process. I know that in gathering and sharing knowledge, as reflection helps us to grow as engineers and as individuals. Iâ€™m passionate about exploring new programming languages and understanding their paradigms. Every language serves a purpose: there is no all-in-one solution.

Architecture and code are living entities: refactoring is an essential evolutionary step in every project. The key to success is striking the right balance between time-to-market architecture and long-term sustainability. This allows us to leave room for future innovation and truly interesting ideas.
